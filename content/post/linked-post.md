Welcome to my blog. My name is Chen Meiyi, I'm from Chengdu, China.

I love music and games, they are part of my life.

I'm a mediocre programmer. Yeah, even a little naive sometimes.

Sharing and learning are import things in my mind. If you are also a person likes sharing and learning and
trying new things no matter they're games, techs, music, food, or intersting books. I'd like to know.
